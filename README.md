# test-github-pages
I create this repo to test how web devs can take advantage of github pages.

GitHub's guide is pretty clear: https://pages.github.com/

After finishing this guide you can clone your GitHub page at SourceLair ([wwww.sourcelair.com](www.sourcelair.com)), and start editing your files.
